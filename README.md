What is it?
===========

I needed a scroll view controller that I could push new views on and scroll to them and even do an infinite scroll type thing. While also maintaining the viewcontroller's action. There must be a better way to do this. So I created this to make it easier; and it is horrible. By putting it in the public, I have to fix it and make it presentable. Right?

Why?
===

* Hopefully I can learn from people making fun of how bad this is.
* After some improvement, maybe it will be better. And even useful.

TODO
====
* actually pass the correct page to load so delegate doesn't have to... 
* Need to do better with the managed array.. need to clean up better (or at all)
* general optimization
* provide option for auto-looping initial views
